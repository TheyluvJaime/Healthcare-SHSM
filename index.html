<h2><center>About the SHSM</center></h2>
<p>The SHSM–Health and Wellness enables students to build a foundation of sector-focused knowledge and skills before graduating and entering apprenticeship training, college, university, or an entry-level position in the workplace. Where local circumstances allow, boards may elect to offer one or more variants of the SHSM in a given sector, each with a particular area of focus. This SHSM may be designed to have a particular focus – for example, on health care, fitness, or child care and family services. This focus is achieved through the selection of the four major credits in the bundle.<br><br> In this website you will find a lot of information regarding why you should chose healtcare as a future, the post secondary options for healthcare if you decide to pursue it as a carrer path and requirements/classes that you need to take to get into certain programs. Please take a look around our website!</p>
