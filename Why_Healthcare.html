<p>Healthcare is one of the best options to pick from as a future carrer due to the extremely high wages and the increasing demand for the job. For example demand for the job is so high nursing is offered as a free program because they are in such despereate need for more of them, and not only just nurses, almost every job in the healthcare field is at an all time low.<br><br> Healthcare is also a great option to choose as a future becuause the path to entering the healthcare field is not one-size-fits-all. Not all healthcare workers need eight years of schooling and a residency before they can begin their careers. For instance, some healthcare roles, like pharmacy technicians or medical assistants, have education options that can be completed in less time than an Associate’s degree.

<br><br>Many others, like surgical technologists, radiologic technologists, physical therapist assistants, medical laboratory technicians and more can find themselves positioned for success with Associate’s degrees. Other roles, like in nursing, offer education pathways from a Practical Nursing Diploma on up to a graduate degree. No matter what your appetite for higher education may be, you can find a healthcare career-focused program to fit your needs.</p>
