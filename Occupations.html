<p><b><h2>Difference between college and university for healthcare jobs</h2></b></p>
<p>Colleges of applied arts and technology have full-time and part-time diploma and certificate programs. Many also offer Bachelor degrees in applied areas of study.<br><br>Colleges tend to be more directly career-oriented than universities. This means they offer practical or hands-on training. Generally, a certificate program is 1 year or less, and a diploma program is 2 or 3 years.</p>

<p>Universities are institutions that can grant degrees. All universities have undergraduate (bachelor's) degrees, and many have graduate (Master's and doctoral) programs. Universities in Ontario are independent. Although they receive funding from the Ministry of Advanced Education and Skills Development, each institution is self-governing and regulates its own programs, admissions and faculty.<br><br>Undergraduate degrees usually take 3-4 years to complete, if you study full-time. An "honours degree" (the fourth year) is usually required if you want to go to a graduate program (Master's degree). Many universities allow students to combine subject areas (e.g., a Bachelor of Science in Chemistry and Biology) into a "double major."</p>
